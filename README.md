Learning Rust Book
---

This repository contains nodes and code from the [Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/title-page.html).
It's mostly for personal reference and practice when reading or revisiting the
book, but hopefully it's some use to you!

## How to navigate
All code from all examples are written in the `src/main.rs` file. However, each
chapter from the book is broken out into a separate branch. For example, to see
the code for chapter 2 "Creating a guessing game", navigate to `02-game`.
